# bitmap-OSD-font
A 'C' bitmap font for on screen display

Derived from 'VCR OSD Mono' (http://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font)

Implements the following 50 character subset of ASCII: 

./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_

All characters are 12x14 pixels. The array is arranged as 14 12-bit elements per character, times 50 characters.

Ideal for embedded systems!
